 USCC (Ultra Super Calculation Computer) Headquarter's Instruction Set Architecture

  System Design:
   - Four function calculator
   - Can only operate on numbers stored in registers
   - Processor receives binary data as 32-bit strings
   - Returns results to the terminal
   - Can operate on 10-bit numbers (0 thru 1023)
   - Results can be negative (5 - 10 = -5)
  Instruction format:
   - 32 bit's in length
   - Binary data will come to the CPU as a string
   - Registers (32 total on CPU, 0-indexed)
      - 0 thru 21:  Available for number storage
        - 0: Constant 0
      - 22 thru 31: Available for history storage

   - Bits 0-5 are OPCODEs
     - use variable 'opcode' in program
   - Bits 6-10 & 11-15 are source register locations
     - use variables 'source_one' and 'source_two' in program
   - Bits 16-25 are reserved for adding a new value to the registers
     - use variable 'store' in program
   - Bits 26-31 are functions
     - use variable 'function_code' in program

 | OPCODE | FUNCTION | Definition                          |
 | 000000 |  100000  | Add two numbers from registers      |
 | 000000 |  100010  | Subtract two numbers from registers |

 | 000000 |  011010  | Divide two numbers from registers   |
 | 000001 |  000000  | Store value to next register        |
 | 100001 |  000000  | Return previous calculation         |
